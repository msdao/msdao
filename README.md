### Summary
This repo contains 3 packages: @msdao/site, @msdao/app and @msdao/lib.

@msdao/site -> msdao.xyz homepage. In the future, we can add the docs and blog as well.

@msdao/app -> dapp.msdao.xyz app, a standalone single-page-app. Should be exportable as a static site for deployment on IPFS.

@msdao/lib -> A shared component and theme library. For now, just a set of resources shared by the above two apps. In the future, this can be extended and published on NPM as a component library for use in other community projects.

### Getting Started

The DAO is looking for react/nexjs devs as well as experienced Solidity devs! Enjoy a flexible work schedule and work on something truly ambitious and meaningful. Compensations available based on your level of experience and degree of contribution.

If you'd like to just take a ticket or fix a bug, go for it (always better to ask first, though).

If you'd like to become a regular contributor to the DAO, join the contributor discord (https://discord.gg/ZNMtjwVE) and follow the application instructions.
